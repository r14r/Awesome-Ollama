We appreciate and recognize all contributors.


# Contribution Guidelines

> Please be aware that we want to accept your contribution, but we have **some rules to keep the minimum quality** of the packages listed here. All reviews are **not personal feedback**, even if you are a _developer reviewing your contribution_. **Sorry, if we can't meet your expectations; we do our best**.

- **To add, remove, or change things on the list:** Submit a pull request

Please contribute links to resources/softwares/packages/projects you have used or are familiar with. This will help ensure high-quality entries.

> the maintainers do not work full-time on the project, meaning that we do not have a set periodicity for reviewing contributions - rest assured that we will do our best to review and eventually accept contributions


## Quality standards

To be on the list, project repositories should adhere to the following quality standards. 

- have an **open source license**, [see list of allowed licenses](https://opensource.org/licenses/alphabetical);
- function as documented and expected;
- be generally useful to the wider community of Go programmers;
- be actively maintained with:
  - regular, recent commits;
  - or, for finished projects, issues and pull requests are responded to generally within 2 weeks;
- be stable or progressing toward stable;
- be thoroughly documented (README etc.) in the English language, so everyone is able to understand the project's intention and how it works. All public functions and types should have a Github Markdown documentation header;

## Preparing for review

Projects listed must have the following in their documentation. When submitting, you will be asked
to provide them.

- A link to the resources


## How to add an item to the list

Open a pull request against the README.md document that adds the repository to the list.

- The pull request should add one and only one item to the list.
- The added item should be in alphabetical order within its category.
- The link should be the name of the package or project.
- Descriptions should be clear, concise, and non-promotional.
- Descriptions should follow the link on the same line and end with a punctuation mark.
- Remember to put a period `.` at the end of the project description.

If you are creating a new category, move the projects that apply to the new category, ensuring
that the resulting list has at least 3 projects in every category, and that the categories are alphabetized.

## Congrats, your project got accepted - what now?
You are an outstanding project now! Feel encouraged to tell others about it by adding one of these badges:  


## How to remove an item from the list

- Open a pull request that deletes the line of the project in question.
- Delete the submission template and substitute a description of which criteria the project is not meeting. It should be a combination of the following.
  - The project has not made an official release within the last year and has open issues.
  - The project is not responding to bug reports issued within 6 months of submission.
  - The project is not meeting quality standards as indicated by the Go Report Card or Code Coverage tests.
  - The quality standard links have been removed from the documentation.
  - The project is no longer open-sourced.
  - The project is incompatible with any version issued within the last year (there is hopefully an open PR about this at the project).

If the project is hosted on GitHub, include a link to the project's submitter and/or author so
that they will be notified of the desire to remove the project and have an opportunity to respond.
The link should be of the form @githubID.


## Reporting issues

Please open an issue if you would like to discuss anything that could be improved or have suggestions for making the list a more valuable resource. We realize sometimes packages fall into abandonment or have breaking builds for extended periods of time, so if you see that, feel free to change its listing, or please let us know. We also realize that sometimes projects are just going through transitions or are more experimental in nature. These can still be cool, but we can indicate them as transitory or experimental.

Removal changes will not be applied until they have been pending for a minimum of 1 week (7 days). This grace window benefits projects that may be going through a temporary transition, but are otherwise worthy of being on the list.

Thanks, everyone!


## How decisions are made

The official group of maintainers has the final decision on what PRs are accepted. Discussions are made openly in issues. Decisions are made by consensus.
